Atari Asteroids Deluxe made in Monogame 3.8 with revision one of Panther engine that includes vector graphic models.
This is the best clone I've made of the game yet.
Next feature coming is high score list, and having it saved to storage.
To play, Side Arrows control rotation. Up arrow thrust, down arrow shield. Left CTRL or Space to fire. Enter to start.
